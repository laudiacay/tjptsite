          <h4>From Tutees:</h4>
          <p>"My friends all want the link to sign up since I'm no longer failing physics :')"</p>
          <p>"I’ve used TJ Peer Tutoring specifically for physics, and it has honestly helped me so much. From working through web assign with me to helping me understand concepts and examples from class, my tutor has been great. I am so glad that Peer Tutoring exists and I would urge anybody struggling in a class to sign up!"</p>
          <p>"I think Peer Tutoring is an awesome idea because who better to teach you a subject than someone your age who has been through the exact same course and understands the struggles of your situation. Personally, physics was a class unlike anything i taken before; i struggled tremendously and felt more or less hopeless, with nobody I could really turn to. Being part of the Peer Tutoring program definitely helped. My tutor explained the way to approach problems that I previously had no idea how to even start, and I have since grown a bit more confident in the subject and my success in the class has gone up as well."</p>

          <h4>From Tutors:</h4>
          <p>"Tutoring is the best way to study for people who don't like studying; if your tutee asks you something you don't know, you look it up, and suddenly the time-value of your work is doubled because you're helping another person! Also it just kinda feels nice helping someone appreciate a subject you like. Service hours too! Incredible value!"</p>
          <p>"TJ Peer Tutoring has helped me not only have fun teaching concepts to students, but also in renewing my own knowledge, and helping the community through the whole process"</p>
          <p>"This is a great opportunity to help fellow students learn a subject that you enjoy. In fact, it is often said that teaching is the true test of whether you fully understand something. When someone asks you a question, if you are unable to answer, then it is likely that you do not truly understand the topic. No need to fret though! You simply have to review your misunderstandings and then teach it to your tutee. There are few experiences as rewarding as tutoring someone and seeing them expand their knowledge in a subject you love."</p>
